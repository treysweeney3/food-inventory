# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Running/Maintaining

This app will use React as its framework. Dependencies are managed by npm and the app is served locally out of Vitejs.

**To run in dev environment:**

`npm install`
*This may be a bit finnicky. Might have to mess with sys variables if on Windows.*

`npm run-script dev`
This will start app locally with default URL http://localhost:5173/

**TODO:** Set up constants for dev/testing/prod environments
